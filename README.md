# Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data

Twitter Sentiment Analysis: Problem Statement

In this project, we try to implement an NLP Twitter sentiment analysis model that helps to overcome the challenges of sentiment classification of tweets. We will be classifying the tweets into positive or negative sentiments. The necessary details regarding the dataset involving the Twitter sentiment analysis project are:

The dataset provided is the Sentiment140 Dataset which consists of 1,600,000 tweets that have been extracted using the Twitter API. The various columns present in this Twitter data are:
•	target: the polarity of the tweet (positive or negative)
•	ids: Unique id of the tweet
•	date: the date of the tweet
•	flag: It refers to the query. If no such query exists, then it is NO QUERY.
•	user: It refers to the name of the user that tweeted
•	text: It refers to the text of the tweet

Preprocessing: The dataset often requires preprocessing steps, such as removing URLs, mentions, special characters, and stopwords, as well as tokenization and lowercasing, before being used for sentiment analysis tasks.

Applications: The Sentiment140 dataset has been widely used for training and evaluating sentiment analysis models, sentiment classification algorithms, and other NLP tasks. Researchers and practitioners use this dataset to develop and benchmark their sentiment analysis techniques.
